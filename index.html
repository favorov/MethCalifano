<h2> Here, we present results of differential analysis of methylation for <a href=2014-02-06_RO1_Batch1-4_ClinicalData_DeID.html>2014-02-06_RO1_Batch1-4_ClinicalData_DeID</a> clinial data file.</h2> 
<p>
<a href= ./Y-chr/Y_chrom_report.html>Here, we compare diffrent measures that are based on the interval data. We look for the best measure to see Y-chromosome differences between males and females.></a> </br> The best measure is just coverage by intervals.
</p>
<p>
<a href= ./CytoBands/CytoBandDM_report.html>Here, we look for cytobands that are differentially methylated.</a> The cytoband information is from UCSC DAS server.
