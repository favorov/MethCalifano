<h2>Results of differential analysis of methylation for HNC.
</h2><h3><a href=2014-02-06_RO1_Batch1-4_ClinicalData_DeID.html>2014-02-06_RO1_Batch1-4_ClinicalData_DeID</a> clinial data file.</h3> 
<p>
Here, we compare diffrent measures that are based on the interval data.</br> 
<a href= ./Y-chr/Y_chrom_report.html>We look for the best measure to see Y-chromosome differences between males and females.</a> </br> The best measure is just coverage by intervals.
</p>
<p>
<a href= ./CytoBands/CytoBandDM_report.html>Here, we look for cytobands that are differentially methylated.</a> The cytoband information is from the UCSC DAS server.
</p>
<a href= ./CpGIs/CpGIsDM_report.html>Here, we look for CpG islands that are differentially methylated.</a> The islands information is from the UCSC DAS server.
